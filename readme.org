This is a basic template latex file for NSF proposals.  It contains a
skeleton proposal file with relevant instructions from the 2015 [[http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/procurement/nraguidebook/proposer2015.pdf][NASA
"Guidebook for Proposers"]].  I did my best to make sure this is
accurate, but it is of course your responsibility to ensure your
proposal meets the requirements.

The formatting is pretty basic and doesnâ€™t really call for a latex
style file.  The only annoying part is making the table of contents
work out correctly.  Starting out with a skeleton file like this and
filling it in as you go is also an easy way to be sure you have all
the required sections.

You can check out the sample in the example/ directory.
